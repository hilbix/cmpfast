O_DIRECT for open() lessens buffer cache impact

Another speedup fix: With O_DIRECT the kernel hopefully uses no buffer
cache for the data, which lessens the memory pressure of cmpfast.  On
some systems it might be that this slows down the performance of
cmpfast itself, however then it reduces overall system load, which is
desireable.
